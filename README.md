# pyState

pyState is a state estimator for electric power systems. It is able to test the target system for observability, critical measurements, and restore it to observability using supplied pseudo-measures.

The state estimation is done through the coupled Newton-Raphson algorithm proposed in Monticelli (1995), testing for jacobian gradient and normalized residue.
